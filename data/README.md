# Educational and Employment Datasets

It is indeed bad form to include datasets with a repository, but as this project is entirely depedent on
this data, and requires the files in order to populate the database from dev to production, they are
included herein.

Educational data is retrieved from the [Integrated PostSecondary Education Data Systems archive](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx)


TODO - Add BLS employment and salary data here in its own folder
